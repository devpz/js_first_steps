First course of JS in my life. 
Just started learning this lang. 
Right now I'm working at company CS Group Polska, where I'm using just HTML, CSS and PHP, 
but I want to improve my skills and in future become a front-end developer. Keep your finger crossed!
IMPORTANT: Any branch is a number of course -> I will try not to miss any courses.
